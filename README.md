# What is Palmares ?

Palmares is a desktop application to help french ballroom dancers to track they own results, as well as those of their friends and opponents.

It automatically crawl the [french](www.ffddansesportive.com) and [international](www.worlddancesport.org) federation website to gather competition results, and present them into clear summaries.

Palmares can also be exported to xlsx files.

# How does it works ?

Palmares is entierly written in Javascript: NodeJS for "core" functionnalities (crawling, [xlsx](https://github.com/stephen-hardy/xlsx.js) export), and browser's JS ([jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap)) for presentation.

Thanks to Node-webkit that provides a desktop-sandalone-nodejs integrated version of the webkit browser it was very easy to reuse my web knowledge to quickly write this application (estimated at 5 working days).

# Users: how to install

Download the last installer [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByVTTZ_jn2IsYmc5b3p3ZDlLNG8&usp=sharing), and follow installation steps.

Only windows is supported for now. For other OS, please contact me or try to build it.

# Developpers: how to building

This project isn't purely Javascript: it's [Coffee Script](http://coffeescript.org/) a javascript preprocessor (i.e. a langage that compiles into plain javascript).
Same story with [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), a css preprocessor.

So, all sources are under `src` folder, and are compiled into `lib` folder, after copying vendor js and css (ones from bootstrap and jquery).

1. install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) if not already the case.
2. clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/feugy/palmares`
3. enter the palmares folder with your shell.
4. globally install Coffeescript: `npm install -g coffee-script@1.6.2`
5. intsall palmares dependencies: `npm install`
6. download [node-webkit binaries](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) into a `bin` folder
7. launch your app from shell: `cake start`

If you change stuff under src, don't forget to compile before launching the application with the shell command `cake build`

To build the windows installer, download [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page), and compile the `installer/installer.nsi` with it.
